TriMet Tracker for Android
==============

TriMet Tracker provides quick access to the Bus and MAX stops that you frequent in the Portland area. This app is especially useful for people who commute frequently and want access to the real time arrival info as quickly as possible.

I created this app because I'm a local who rides TriMet almost every day and I needed an app that let me get arrival info with as few taps as possible, and no other TriMet app was up to my standards. I hope you will find it as useful as I have.

There is also an ad-free version available in the Play Store.

Features:

* Keep a list of your favorite stops
* Sort your stops by most visited and most recently visited
* View the real-time arrival estimates for each Bus/MAX stop. Stops automatically refresh whenever you open the app and every 30 seconds.
* Get detour information.
* Go straight to the TriMet mobile site with schedule and other information.
* Find stops near you using GPS.
* Find a stop from a list of bus routes.

Planned Features:

* A Dark/Night theme
